EXTRACT_CLAIMS_PROMPT = """\
Your task is to extract and list significant, verifiable claims from the post provided. Each claim must:
- Have a clearly identifiable subject (e.g., a named person, organization, or entity).
- Provide sufficient context so that it can be independently verified.
- NOT be a trivial or merely descriptive summary of data trends. Avoid claims that only restate observable facts (for example, a simple increase in numbers) unless they include an evaluative judgment, causal assertion, or novel conclusion.
- NOT be based solely on vague observations, personal anecdotes, or references to unnamed characters.

ONLY respond with the claims, and nothing else. Do NOT number the claims.
Each claim should appear on a separate line.
